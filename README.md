# ABOUT RUNDECK

We built the Rundeck software platform to enable operations run more efficiently
and scale faster while maintaining security and compliance.We call it Self-Service
Operations and it’s transforming the way services are
operated at organizations of all sizes across every industry.
Operations work is caught in a squeeze between the demands of the business to go faster
and maintain a competitive edge and the security and compliance constraints needed to
avoid breaches.Of course, this is in addition to all of the requests — planned and
unplanned — from management, teammates, and customers.These conflicting requirements often
leave teams overworked, inefficient, and a perceived roadblock.Rundeck modernizes Operations
work by allowing a broader number of people — even those outside of traditional Operations
boundaries— to have secure and safe self-service access to Operations tasks. Our customers report
a significant reductions in interruptions, faster incident response times, and improved visibility
into Ops related activities. Rundeck works with existing tools and scripts, so there is a minimal learning curve.
